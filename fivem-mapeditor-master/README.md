A Map Editor for FiveM

Work in progress :)

Press F10 to open the main menu.
Shift and ALT are used to speed up/down moving/rotating etc

Currently focused on race building.

Thanks to:
* Guadmaz for his Map Editor where I drew inspiration from.
* R* North for their Creator, which I try to replicate.
* The CitizenFX Collective for making an awesome modding framework.
